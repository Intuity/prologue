This is an example of all of the features of Prologue.

For example, a constant can be defined:


A test can be performed on whether the constant is defined:

Of course flag is defined


A constant can also take a value:


Which can then be printed -> A=123, B=234, A+B=357

Values can be tested - here implicit substitution is used:

A (123) is less than B (234)

A second file can be included - the contents of the second file appear every time
the file is included:

First time:
This is the content of the second file - included 1 time(s)

Second time:
This is the content of the second file - included 2 time(s)

How many times was second.txt included? 2 time(s)

Alternatively a file can be imported - in which case it appears only the first
time the file is every imported:

First time:
This is the content of the third file - included 1 time(s)

Second time:

How many times was third.txt imported? 1 time(s)

Messages can help debug preprocessor behaviour:

[PROLOGUE:INFO] Highest verbosity message - for information and debug
[PROLOGUE:WARN] Medium verbosity message - for warnings

A third class 'error' also exists - which will abort processing immediately.

Loops can be used to generate more complex logic:

This is apple number 0
This is orange number 0
This is cherry number 0
This is peach number 0
This is apple number 1
This is orange number 1
This is cherry number 1
This is peach number 1
This is apple number 2
The fruit is 'apple' and the integer is greater than 1
This is orange number 2
This is cherry number 2
This is peach number 2
