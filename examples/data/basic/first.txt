This is the first line
...and now the second line...
here comes a gap

...then the fifth line.
Here comes an anchored directive:
#if A > 2
  #if B < 3
    Hello world
  #else
    Banana
  #endif
#endif
Then we'll have a floating directive:
This is a string #warning This is floating!
What about a single line anchored directive?
#info This is anchored!
  #info This is anchored but tabbed in
And back to the baseline
