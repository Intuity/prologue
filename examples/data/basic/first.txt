This is the first line
...and now the second line...
here comes a gap

...then the fifth line.
Here comes an anchored directive:
#define A 5
#define B 3
#undef A
#define A 10
#if A > 2
  #if B < (A - 4)
    Hello world
    #for j in range(15):
      Repeating for the $(j) time
      #if j == 3:
        This is the fourth time
      #elif j > 9:
        This is the 11th or above time
      #endif
    #endfor
    #for x in [1, 2, A, 3, B]:
      This is using value $(x)
    #endfor
  #else
    Banana
    #for i in range(10):
      Fruit $(i)
    #endfor
  #endif
#endif

#include "second.txt"

Then we'll have a floating directive:
This is a string #warning This is floating!
What about a single line anchored directive?
#info This is anchored!
  #info This is anchored but tabbed in
And back to the baseline
